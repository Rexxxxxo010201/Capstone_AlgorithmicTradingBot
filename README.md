# Capstone_AlgorithmicTradingBot
This is the initial prototype of our capstone project. We aim to dive into the field of financial machine learning by building an algorithmic trading bot. This would be used to make better investment decisions and for seeking out more profitable trades. A lot of time is spent by traders on continuous monitoring of transactions. These activities can instead be monitored by the trading bot, thereby saving cost and time for constant supervision. This would lead to a reduction in transaction costs. It would also greatly reduce the possibility of human errors while placing trades. The bot can be used for institutional investors and big brokerage houses for both stock market companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) as well as cryptocurrency investments like Bitcoin and Ethereum (BTCUSD, ETHUSD). We have implemented two machine learning algorithms using the concepts of ensemble learning and support vector machine. A random forest regressor is implemented into the buy-and-hold trading strategy for long-term investments and a support vector regressor is implemented into the scalping trading strategy for short-term investments. We would later implement multiple trading strategies using a combination of recurrent neural networks and sentiment analysis on real-time data.
